Thanks for your help. :)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Don't translate {## some description ##} part. It's place holder for "words".
And the description is for what words are placed.

example) 

Photo is moved to the  {##  album name ##}   album.
==> This message will be 

"Photo is moved to the  MyPet album." or  "Photo is moved to the  Family album." or  "Photo is moved to the Screenshot album."


{## count of photo/video ##}   photos is moved to {##  album name ##}  
==> This message will be 

"123  photos is moved to MyPet" or  "50  photos is moved to Family" or  "777  photos is moved to Screenshot".
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
And { TO_Translator: some descrption } is for your undestading. ( Don't translate between '{' and  '}' )

example) 

No location
{ TO_Translator: no gps information in a photo. ( part of detail information of a photo) }  <=== this is for your understanding. Don't translate.
